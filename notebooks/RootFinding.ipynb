    "Very often we want to find roots, or zeroes, of equations. Perhaps we want to know at what $x$ a function $f(x)$ is equal to 0. Perhaps we want to know where the function $f(x)$ intersects the function $g(x)$. Perhaps we want to find a maximum or minimum of an equation $f(x)$. All of these problems can be formulated as root-finding problems -- and root-finding problems can be considered part of a broader class of optimization problems, which we will explore further in this course soon. So today, let's explore how we find roots numerically!"

A more detailed description of the algorithm is as follows:\n",
