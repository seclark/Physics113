This will mostly close out our in-class exploration of ODEs, although we will revisit and build on certain concepts. The final problem asks you to think about how you would put together several methods we have discussed in order to solve a boundary-value ODE problem.  "

    "## Boundary Value Problems: Putting the Pieces Together\n",
    "\n",
    "We have now solved a number of different ODEs in this class, starting with simple first-order differential equations and working our way up to second-order ODEs and coupled systems of nonlinear ODEs. We have explored a number of numerical techniques for solving ODE problems. However there is one thing that all of the problems we've tackled thus far have in common: they are all **initial value problems**, i.e., we are given the state of the system at some time, and evolving the system forward in time from there. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course there is another type of ODE problem, a **boundary value problem**, or BVP. Say for example we throw a ball up into the air:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -g$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity and there is no air resistance. To solve this we need two conditions, e.g. the starting height and velocity of the ball at time 0 (an IVP) or the height of the ball at two starting and ending times. For example, suppose we were told that the ball has height $x=0$ at $t=0$ and it reaches $x=0$ again at time $t=10$ seconds. What was the ball's initial velocity?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Shooting Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The shooting method is a trial-and-error method that searches for the correct initial conditions in order to satisfy the boundary conditions. The idea for the ball example would be to guess an initial upward velocity, solve the differential equation until time $t = 10$ seconds, and then ask whether the ball had reached height 0 (i.e., see if we guessed right). We probably didn't -- we probably overshot or undershot, in which case we should modify our initial velocity guess and try again. \n",
    "\n",
